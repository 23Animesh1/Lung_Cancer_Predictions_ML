# Lung Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict lung cancer presence using patient data. The model leverages feature engineering and classifier algorithms to provide accurate predictions.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Multiple classifiers for evaluation: Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- Easy-to-use Python scripts

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/lung-cancer-detection.git
   cd lung-cancer-detection
